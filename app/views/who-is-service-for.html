      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Who the service is for</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">This service is for grassroots, voluntary and community groups, and other local organisations in England.</p>
      <p>Many groups in the UK are already providing outstanding support to their communities, especially during COVID-19.  When local organisations need extra support they can also approach:</p> 
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            <a class="govuk-link" href="https://navca.org.uk/find-a-member-1">local council for voluntary service</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">local authority</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-resilience-forums-contact-details">local resilience forum</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            other local infrastructure bodies
          </li>
        </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to use the service</h2>

  <p>There are times when there is no local capacity to provide the support required. When that happens, local organisations can make a request for support from the new ‘Get support as a local organisation’ service.
  </p>
  <p>Requests are reviewed by local liaison leads, who find help locally or escalate to a regional panel of voluntary and community groups.</p>
