      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Step-by-step for liaison leads</h1>
      <p class="govuk-body">Please note, we are operating a phased launch of the service.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">For phase 1 of the service, only liaison leads will be able to submit requests for support on behalf of a local community or voluntary organisation.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">For phase 2, the service will also be open to local community or voluntary organisations to make requests for support.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 1. Complete information governance training</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">To get started on SharePoint, complete the information governance training provided by the British Red Cross on the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) e-learning platform.</p>
      <p><a href="/data-sharing/information-governance-training">Access information governance training instructions</a></p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 2. Attend service introduction training</h3>
      <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1861mTBtgZzOTkJhR-Po-uz3VuT3suPKYmWXZs0lVANQ/edit">Slides from the service introduction training.</a></p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 3. Log into SharePoint</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">Once you have completed both training sessions, you will be sent login details for SharePoint by the VCS EP 'Request support as a voluntary or community organisation' service team.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You have VIEW ONLY access to SharePoint.</p>

      <p><a href="/using-sharepoint/sharepoint-for-liaison-leads">Access SharePoint step-by-step for liaison leads.</a></p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 4. Make a request for support</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.redcross.org.uk/vcsep-support">Complete the online form</a> to make requests for support for a voluntary or community organisation in your area.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You will receive a copy of your submission via email.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 5. Missing information </h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Sometimes, information might be missng from the form you have submitted.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">For example, you might have mistakenly only written a word in the 'Give more details' question, instead of full sentences, describing what type of support is needed.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If this happens, you will receive an email from the Information Manager, asking you to provide the missing information.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 6. Requests assigned to you in SharePoint</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can see that the requests you have submitted when you login in SharePoint.
      <p class="govuk-body">During launch 1, we are assuming you are only sending in requests that cannot be met locally. These will automatically be escalated for brokering at the Regional Tactical Cell meeting, requiring no further action from you.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 6a. Requests assigned to you, marked 'For Triage'</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">During launch 2, when organisations can submit their own requests for support, you will be asked to review the requests assigned to you in SharePoint labelled 'For Triage', before they can be escalated for brokering at the Regional Tactical Cell meeting.</p>

    <p><a href="/staying-local-or-escalating/index">When to try and broker locally and when to escalate<a></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Please note, we are aware that some liaison leads cover large areas and therefore this level of triaging might not be possible. In these cases, we suggest you reach out to you local infrastructure bodies as the first port of call. If this is not successful, please request an escalation for brokering at the Tactical Cell meeting.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 7. More information required for a broker</h3>
      <p>Information managers will present requests at the Regional Tactical Cell Meetings.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, brokers will consider whether they can respond to a request, based on whether they:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>already provide this service</li>
        <li>already work in the target areas</li>
        <li>have sufficient capacity in the target areas</li>
        <li>have expertise with this target audience</li>
        <li>can commit to the timescale of the request</li>
       </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">If a broker needs more information the information manager will email you, asking you to contact the local organisation for more information.</p>

      <p><a href="/following-up-with-orgs/getting-information-for-request">Follow these steps to get more information from a local organisation<a></p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 8. A regional broker has been found</h3>
        <p>When a broker has been found, the local organisation, the broker who agreed to take on the request and you (as liaison lead) will be notified via email with the details of:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>how they can help</li>
          <li>when they can help</li>
          <li>who is going to be helping</li>
         </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">This is so that all involved know that the request for support has been met.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You will see in SharePoint that the status has been updated to ‘Broker found’.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you discover that the local organisation has not heard from the broker within 7 days, please let the VCSEP service team know.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 9. Check request has been fulfilled</h3>
        <p>At the next Regional Tactical Cell regular meeting, the Tactical Cell lead checks with the broker that the request has been fulfilled.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If the broker has been unable to fulfill the request, it is presented at the meeting again to find a new broker.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 10. Case is closed in SharePoint</h3>
        <p>Once it has been confirmed that:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>a broker has been found</li>
          and
          <li>they have been able to fulfill the request</li>
         </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">The request status is updated to “Closed” in SharePoint.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
